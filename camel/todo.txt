
!! important loading thing !!
make the structure update in img class
make the thing do the work

make a userinput class
make a thing that deals with the other thing


3.1, class that does dialogue (strain another friendship)

4, class that deals with game flow control

5, class that deals with integration hell (imma have a lot of fun here)

tie loading directly to images class

do the swing text stuff
^^
i dislike this a lot, but imma do it anyways

finish IMG and loading class so that the countries are arrays too (i regret this)
^^
yeah this sucks

drink more tea






follow-ups:
ask about images
get mic for audio for the YT vid (you know who I'm talking about)
screen size should be flexible, camels centered in frame

this hurts a lot
i dont know why im doing this
